    "To get started running the Quantum Kernel Training (QKT) Toolkit demos and tutorials, users should first clone the repository and install the required dependencies.\n",

    "### Clone the Repository\n",
    "Navigate to your workspace and clone the repository using the HTTPS address.\n",
    "\n",
    "`cd path/to/your/workspace`\n",
    "\n",
    "`git clone https://github.ibm.com/IBM-Q-Software/quantum-kernel-training.git`\n",

    "### Create a Fresh Python Development Environment\n",
    "To avoid dependency conflicts, it is recommended to first start a new Python development environment. We use [conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html) in this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda create -n qkt-tookit python=3.9`\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Install Dependencies\n",
    "Once a fresh environment has been created, installing the dependencies should be straightforward. Navigate to the\n",
    "top level of the repository and:\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install -r requirements.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test Your Environment\n",
    "To make sure the notebooks will run on your local machine, you may test the QKT Toolkit locally. From the top directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "`make test`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Play Around\n",
    "After the dependencies have installed, users may run the [tutorials](https://github.ibm.com/IBM-Q-Software/quantum-kernel-training/tree/main/docs/tutorials) and [guides](https://github.ibm.com/IBM-Q-Software/quantum-kernel-training/tree/main/docs/how_tos) on their local machines.\n"
